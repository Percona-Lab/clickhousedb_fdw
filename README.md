## What is clickhousedb_fdw?
The clickhousedb_fdw is open-source. It is a Foreign Data Wrapper (FDW) for one of the fastest column store databases; "Clickhouse". This FDW allows you to SELECT from, and INSERT into, a ClickHouse database from within a PostgreSQL server. The FDW supports advanced features like aggregate pushdown and joins pushdown. These significantly improve performance by utilizing the remote serverâ€™s resources for these resource intensive operations.
